                  name of species to be displayed
   - tempList: list of numbers,
               temperatures of the environment the species grow in
   - initialNumCells: number (integer),
                      the initial number (before growth) of cells
   - timeInterval: number (integer),
                   time interval in minutes the growth of each species is
                   calculated (for display on line graph)
   - graphData: data on the number of each species' (listed in speciesList)
                cells at each calculated time interval
                (lower index, earlier time --> higher index, later time)

/* Description of Each Species Object...
   - maxTemp: number (integer),
              highest temperature in degrees Celsius in which bacteria grows
   - minTemp: number (integer),
              lowest temperature in degrees Celsius in which bacteria grows
   - maxDivTemp: number (integer),
                 temperature in degrees Celsius in which the species
                 divides at its greatest speed
   - maxDivTime: number (integer),
                 time in minutes division occurs when the species divides at
                 its greatest speed (currTemp is equal to maxDivTemp)
   - divSlowRate: number (float/double),
                  rate in percentage division slows for each degree Celsius off
                  from maxDivTemp
   - environment: string,
                  the oxygen environment in which the species can grow...
                    "o" - oxygen; can only grow in environments with oxygen
                    "a" - anaerobic; can only grow in environments without oxygen
                    "b" - both; can grow in environments with or without oxygen

/* Additional Notes for Team
   - divSlowRate is a percentage and a decimal; it is the rate in which
     division slows therefore the current division rate for a species would be
     (1 - (divSlowRate * (Math.absolute(maxDivTemp - currTemp))))
     or something similar
   - environment is a string, supporting the future possibility of species
     being able to grow in both oxygen and low/no oxygen environments, but is
     currently be implemented as strictly oxygen or anaerobic
   - The list of bacteria being used for the simulation is independent of the
     JSON objects written here; these objects are purely data that should be
     accessed and compared to the current simulation variables
     Therefore the objects are constants
   - I suggest the current list of species being displayed for the simulation
     be a list of JSON objects with name, currTemp, divRate, ... which can be
     compared to these constant JSON objects
